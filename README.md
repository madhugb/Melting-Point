# Melting Point

Melting Point is a simple multi-player game concept in this game user will run against obstacles to protect his ice-cream from melting (I know kind of stupid!).

The game is played on top of real google map street view. In every path user will be exposed to different challenges 
and given different tasks.

There will be live status of ice-cream melting. At the end of the run depending upon the condition of ice-cream and user's energy level, he gets the rewards.

User can spend his rewards to purchase different accessories and gadgets to reach the destination faster or protecting his ice-cream.

User can purchase the accessories by doing additional activities like inviting friends to game, sharing his scores in social networks and also paying actual currency (not sure why anyone will do that).
